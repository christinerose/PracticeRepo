# PracticeRepo

Created as a place for colleagues to practice using Git in order to work on (Docs as Code) documentation with engineers. This can all be done on the command line (CLI), too. It's good to learn that overall, especially if you're working on lots of documents in a single repo. For now, I'm going to show you on the GitHub interface, so you can understand the concepts. 

### Steps
1. Fork this repo. Upper right corner of this page, click on "Fork." Now you have a copy of this repo in your own GitHub. Go look for that now. A copy of this README will be there as well as everything else in the repo. 
2. Make a branch. This is so you don't mess up the "main" branch (sometimes called "master" branch), which is the *live* branch. Any changes you make won't show up on the main branch until the maintainers merge your branch. 
  - Click on where you see "Main" on the left above, then name your branch by typing in the "Find or create branch..." field.

  - Name it with something short & relevant to the changes you're making.
  - Once you type in the name, it will appear right below. Click on that to create it.

  - Navigate to it in that dropdown menu if it doesn't directly take you there, which it should. Just ensure you're on the correct branch when you're working.

3. Make your changes. Most documentation on GitHub is written in Markdown, a relatively-simple language. Familiarize yourself with it and use this [cheetsheet](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/) for help. You will find the documentation and other content under "code" in the very-top left, under the repo's name. (Not the green button called "Code" on the right. That's for cloning your repo to a local machine using the CLI or a different app.

Formerly called: **IssueTestRepo**

Testing ways to enable engineers to submit issues for writing requests. My team found it to be a good way to track writing projects. We'll be going over that in this repo as well.
